# Carbon
This was a codebase I built as a teenager in highschool. Over the years, I added mesh loading/rendering, Tetris, homemade sorting algorithms, and a showcase of emergent behavior. Runs on SDL, so it draws every pixel, because I wanted to practice with low-level code.

carbon-tetris is an implementation of tetris.

To build, you must correctly link SDL2.
