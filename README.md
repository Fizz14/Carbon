# Carbon
This was a codebase I built as a teenager in highschool. Over the years, I added mesh loading/rendering, Tetris, homemade sorting algorithms, and a showcase of emergent behavior. Runs on SDL, so it draws every pixel, because I wanted to practice with low-level code.

carbon-sort features a visualization for sorting algorithms. Mysteriously, I chose to put the sorting algorithms in the carbon.cpp main() instead of 
their own header, but this does make adding your own algorithms very easy.

To build, you must correctly link SDL2.
