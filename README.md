# Carbon
This was a codebase I built as a teenager in highschool. Over the years, I added mesh loading/rendering, Tetris, homemade sorting algorithms, and a showcase of emergent behavior. Runs on SDL, so it draws every pixel, because I wanted to practice with low-level code.

carbon-boids was the third fork I made to my project. It is used to demonstrate emergent behavior by simulation little bird-like creatures who flock and break apart
while flying on the screen. 

To build, you must resolve linker errors with SDL2.
