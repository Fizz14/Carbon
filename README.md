# Carbon
This was a codebase I built as a teenager in highschool. Over the years, I added mesh loading/rendering, Tetris, homemade sorting algorithms, and a showcase of emergent behavior. Runs on SDL, so it draws every pixel, because I wanted to practice with low-level code.

The "main" branch is a copy of the carbon-boids branch. It is the most developed and contains parts of each other branch, except for carbon-sort.
